# ProgramDesign-2015
Introduction to Program Design, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Fall 2015

Course Objectives: CS 1101 is designed to help you identify problems that programs can solve and to learn how to design programs that solve problems. Program design involves a series of smaller skills, including information design, logic design, testing, and documentation. Improving your skills in these areas should help you with general problem solving even when you aren't programming.
